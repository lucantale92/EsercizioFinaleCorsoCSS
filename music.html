        <h1 id="titlePunkMusic">Punk: The Sound of Revolution</h1>
        <p>Punk is a musical current that shook the international scene with its raw energy and minimalist approach. Born in underground clubs, it transformed anger and social discomfort into direct, no-nonsense music. Rapid tracks, aggressive riffs and provocative lyrics made punk a weapon of protest, capable of creating community and inspiring entire generations to never conform.</p>

        <h2>Top 5 punk bands of all time</h2>

        <figure>
            <h3>Sex Pistols</h3>
            <img src="images/sex-pistols.jpg" alt="Sex Pistols photo">
            <figcaption>The Sex Pistols were not just a band: they were a punch in the stomach to the system. With just a few songs they wreaked havoc, shouting anger and rebellion to anyone who would listen.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h3>The Clash</h3>
            <img src="images/the-clash.jpg" alt="The Clash photo">
            <figcaption>With the Clash, punk found brains as well as brawn. Dirty but powerful melodies, contaminated rhythms and words that made you think: they were the revolution with a guitar in their hands.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h3>Ramones</h3>
            <img src="images/ramones.jpg" alt="Ramones photo">
            <figcaption>The Ramones took rock, sped it up and cut it to the bone. Short songs, three chords and lots of energy: their punk was pure, direct and unadulterated.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h3>NOFX</h3>
            <img src="images/Nofx.jpg" alt="Nofx photo">
            <figcaption>With NOFX, punk took an irreverent and unregulated turn. Politics, black humour and a lot of energy: their music was a middle finger to the system and also to themselves.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h3>Green Day</h3>
            <img src="images/Green-day.jpg" alt="Green Day photo">
            <figcaption>With Green Day, punk became generational. Since the 1990s they have given voice to those who felt out of place, mixing speed, anger and refrains that never left you.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h3>Black Flag</h3>
            <img src="images/black-flag.jpg" alt="Black Flag photo">
            <figcaption>Black Flag were pure rage. Fast, hard and uncompromising, they turned American punk into a scream against everything: society, authority and even themselves.</figcaption>
