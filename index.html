        <h1>The Punk: lifestyle as well as music</h1>
        <p>Punk has never been just a musical genre: it is a cry of rebellion, a way of life, an aesthetic that challenges imposed rules. Born in the 1970s as a cultural movement, punk combined rough and direct sounds with a non-conformist attitude, giving voice to those who did not recognise themselves in social conventions.</p>

        <h2>More than a soundtrack</h2>
        <p>Fast, raw, no-frills punk music provided the soundtrack for a generation that rejected fashions imposed from above. But behind the distorted notes and irreverent lyrics lay much more: the desire to assert their freedom, to express an authentic identity, far from consumerism and the rigid rules of society.</p>
        <h2>A style that becomes a manifesto</h2>
        <p>Coloured crests, studded leather jackets, ripped jeans, pins and patches: punk style became a real visual language. It was not just 'clothing', but a clear and immediate message: 'I do not conform'. Every detail told a statement, an identity that could not go unnoticed.</p>
        <h2>An attitude that endures</h2>
        <p>Punk has survived the decades, transforming itself and contaminating new musical and artistic languages. Today it is still synonymous with freedom, independence and critical spirit. It does not matter whether you play in a band, write fanzines or simply live with a rebellious attitude: being punk means choosing to be yourself, without compromise.</p>
